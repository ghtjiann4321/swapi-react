## SWAPI - React

A project created in React/Redux that displays the characters of star wars using the SWAPI endpoint.

#### Backlog

- ~~Incomplete unit test files~~
- ~~Fade animation on spinner component not working~~

### Future Improvements

- React Virtualized for list display
- Only display vehicle table if all api call to is completed
- Error handling if API call failed

### IMPORTANT

<span style="color:red">I encounterd a CORS related issue using the SWAPI endpoint. If the SWAPI endpoint is encountering any CORS issue, try installing the Chrome extension called "Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: \*". I am not really sure but recently, I tried turning the extension off and it calls the api successfully.</span>
